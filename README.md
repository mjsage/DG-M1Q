# DG-M1Q
A quick hack to provide access to the sd card using a http server and set the time using ntpd.

Remounts the sd card with execute permission, and runs a httpd server on port 80 with sdcard:/npc/ as home directory and creates a list of links to download the recordings and images.

__Username:__ admin __Pass:__ cheese __#edit httpd.conf to change__


Unzip [sdcard.zip](https://github.com/mjsage/DG-M1Q/raw/master/sdcard.zip) to root of SD card.
telnet the camera, username root, no password. Then enter the following command

sh /mnt/disc1/httpd.sh


Can be made to run at boot if required by modifying the camera's /npc/boot.sh (see included boot.sh in zip).

httpd.sh is set up to look for a time server on 192.168.1.1, edit httpd.sh to change IP.


A windows batch file is provided to open this camera's .av files in VLC 


Video settings for the app streams can apparently be found in /npc/congig/video_sc1135.xml and /npc/congig/image_sc1135.xml. I couldn't see any difference on the small low-res screen of my mobile phone. Be careful editing, the wrong values may crash the camera - I'd try to telnet in after rebooting and killall npc if that happens, unfortunately these do not appear to have any effect on the very low bitrate of the poor quality ONVIF / RTSP stream.

Instead of using the audio tones of the app, the Wifi password for this camera can be configured using a text file, wifiInfo.txt in the root of the sd card: https://web.archive.org/web/20180201150239/https://www.mydigoo.com/Digoo-DG-M1Q-Can%60t-Connect-Problem-Fixed-p-42.html . I think the camera should also boot with an open wifi AP before it is set up. 


The m1q.vfat.img (busybox in a mountable image as an alternative to remounting the SD card) and sample.WifiInfo.txt aren't required and can be deleted.
